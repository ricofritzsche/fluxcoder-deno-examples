# Simple Web Server with Deno and Oak
## About

This repository contains code examples and tutorials for setting up web servers
using Deno and TypeScript. This first example demonstrates how to create a simple 
web server with Deno and Oak. It serves a static message "Welcome to FluxCoder!" when accessed.

## Prerequisites

    Deno must be installed on your system.
    Basic understanding of TypeScript and web servers.

## Features

    üöÄ Quick and Easy: Get a web server up and running in seconds.
    üå≥ Oak Middleware: Utilizes Oak, a popular middleware framework for Deno.
    üìù Well-commented Code: Code is easy to understand.
    üõ†Ô∏è Customizable: Easily extend the server's functionality.

### Installation & Usage
## Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ricofritzsche/fluxcoder-deno-examples.git
```

### Navigate to the Directory

Go to the directory containing the code.

```bash
cd fluxcoder-deno-examples
```

### Run the Server
Run the server using the following command:

```bash
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

After running the command, you should see the output:
